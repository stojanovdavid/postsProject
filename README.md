## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

We can create both categories and posts in the navigation bar
                                                   
                                                   
  Categories:
                                                   
   ![ccreate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90925461/161109648-05c0fe88-9b0f-41ca-b381-133bd6751f55.png)

                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
  Posts: We can give the post categories in which the post belongs and we can add tags to the post
                                                  
   ![pcreate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90925461/161111697-92a44e78-0bc5-40ed-be28-d59b365871ff.png)


                                                
  We can click our categories and see all the posts that are in that category. Also, only the user who published
  the post can edit it or delete it
                                                
   ![post](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90925461/161110637-4b0d2548-1998-43c4-a367-4812ff7815d7.png)


We then can view the post and its comments, and just like the posts, the user can only edit or delete his own comment
(We are seeing Abby's perspective on John's post)
   ![postc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90925461/161111060-d6ee2638-7a99-40e7-a29f-43608cf1217a.png)

                                                    
Also, when we click the tags, we can see all the posts that go under that tag. For example, when we click on "Health", we will be given all the posts that have the tag "Health" on them
