                                                              This is my project



                                      This is the page that the user is going to be redirected after registering and loging in

We can create both categories and posts in the navigation bar
                                                   
                                                   
  Categories:

  Posts: We can give the post categories in which the post belongs and we can add tags to the post

  We can click our categories and see all the posts that are in that category. Also, only the user who published
  the post can edit it or delete it
  
  ![postlikes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90925461/161946886-bc2f8a05-2d71-4a70-9253-d5373d6920c4.png)



We then can view the post and its comments, and just like the posts, the user can only edit or delete his own comment
(We are seeing Abby's perspective on John's post)

Also, when we click the tags, we can see all the posts that go under that tag. For example, when we click on "Health", we will be given all the posts that have the tag "Health" on them
